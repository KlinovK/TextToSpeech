# SpeechToText AI

A futuristic iOS app that transforms your **voice into intelligent AI conversations**. Built entirely with **SwiftUI** and a custom implementation of the **TCA (The Composable Architecture)** pattern for a clean, reactive, and testable structure. The app leverages **Apple‚Äôs Speech framework** for on-device transcription and integrates with **local LLMs via Ollama**, enabling private, offline-friendly AI chat.  

Featuring a **glassmorphic, AI-inspired interface** with smooth animations, glowing chat bubbles, and real-time recording feedback, VOICECHAT AI brings a conversational AI experience to your fingertips ‚Äî powered by your own voice.

## Architecture

VOICECHAT AI follows the **TCA (The Composable Architecture)** pattern with a clean separation between state, actions, and environment dependencies.

### Layered Structure

- **View Layer (SwiftUI)**  
  Handles UI rendering, animations, and reactive bindings to app state.

- **Reducer Layer**  
  Defines all user interactions, state transitions, and side effects like speech recognition and AI calls.

- **Environment Layer**  
  Manages dependencies including the speech recognizer and Ollama network client.
